# Roadmap

Just ping brent@scheibelhut.com on email to ask things you want to see here

- Data visualizations for likes
- Local data storage of courses on Calendar - so when you come back they're there (don't need Scheduler currently)
- Can't take with current classes that are on calendar? (mark as CONFLICT)
- Moar Testssss
- Add buttons to mobile experience
- Make immortal by putting all data in one file
