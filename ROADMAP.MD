# Roadmap

Just ping brent@scheibelhut.com on email to ask things you want to see here

- Clean up headers, so they're not shown when the list has no elements
- Data visualizations for likes
- Print number of courses beside course matches
- Local data storage of courses on Calendar - so when you come back they're there (don't need Scheduler currently)
- Can't take with current classes (cart of classes?)(already taking some classes add here)(CONFLICT)
- Have online courses appear below calendar when added
- Tests. Tests. Tests.
