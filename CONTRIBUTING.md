# Contributing

Just ping brent@scheibelhut.com on email to ask about contributing.

Basically anything on the roadmap you can tackle.

We use the testing library [Zombie](http://zombie.js.org/) for our tests. Tests are run with `npm test`. Please run these to make sure they pass before the submitting a PR. Try to add tests for your PR if necessary. :)

More than happy to help get you started!
